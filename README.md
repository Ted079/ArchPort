## 🎯 Project Goal
This project was built to practice full-stack development (MERN), learn backend basics, improve TypeScript skills on both client and server, and work with file uploads and image storage.
The main idea is to create a platform for architecture students to publish their projects — while I gain hands-on experience with modern frontend and backend technologies.
